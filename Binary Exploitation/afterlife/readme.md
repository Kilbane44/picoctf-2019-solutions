# AfterLife - 400 Points

This challenge is nearly identical to SecondLife, with the following changes:

* We now overwrite the free block with a use-after-free vulnerability. In this scenario, the process of exploiting this is identical to the double-free in SecondLife.
* The shellcode must be passed as a commandline argument, meaning the shellcode cannot be dependant on the heap position (since we won't know the heap address until the program runs). This basically means no relative jumps, but our SecondLife solution used a static return anyways so it doesn't matter.
* The address of the win function changed slightly.

See the SecondLife solution for more information.
