# CanaRy - 300 Points

The canary is 4 bytes at the end of the stack. The application does a check before exiting the function to make sure the canary matches the original.
If the canary has changed, the program assumes a buffer overflow occurred and exits the program to prevent malicious code from executing.
In the real world, these canary checks are added to code   vb990 automatically by the compiler, and the bytes are generated randomly every time a function is called.
For the purpose of the challenge, the canary is static and loaded from canary.txt.

This program brute-forces the canary by overwriting one byte at a time. It writes every possible value in each position of the canary
until the program doesn't exit. If it doesn't exit, that means the byte that was written was the same byte that was already there, so that
byte of the canary has been solved. The canary is 4 bytes in total, meaning only a maximum of 256^4 checks are required to brute-force it.

Once the canary is determined, the challenge is just a simple buffer overflow challenge like buffer-overflow-1 to jump to display_flag(), 
just making sure to include the correct canary value in the payload.

at the location specified in the source code on your system or only run the script on the shell server.
