# Heap overflow - 450 Points

This challenge is similar to SecondLife and AfterLife, but we instead have to use a heap overflow to exploit an old version of free called Doug Lea's free (dlfree).

For an explanation of exploiting dlfree, see [this page](https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/hh/hh-11.html).

The example on the above page doesn't work as-is, as the free order is different. Adjusting for that, we can rewrite the address of puts in the GOT to jump to our shellcode (which is called after the first free). Our shellcode then jumps to win like in SecondLife and AfterLife.

Due to whatever issues, working chunk sizes can differ on different systems. The script adjusts the chunk size in a loop until the flag is printed.
