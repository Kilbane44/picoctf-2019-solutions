This challenge lets you write a 4 byte value at any index in the array. However, the index you type in is not checked to make sure it is actually within the array, giving you a 4 byte arbitrary write to anywhere in memory. The index can even be negative to write behind the array.

To solve this, you can either overwrite the exit pointer in the GOT with the address of win, or overwrite the return pointer of the function to jump to win. The latter is easier since you don't have to deal with ASLR on the stack.
