# messy-malloc - 300 Points

This problem was solved entirely through guess and check.

The program prints out whatever it reads as the access code. With this, it's pretty easy to just "do stuff"
until it starts producing results.

I first created functions to interact with the programs menu automatically. I then ran some of these functions in a loop,
passing the access code as the name. Eventually, the program started showing that it was reading the access code, but the
alignment was off. I adjusted the alignment and got the flag.

See, you don't actually have to *understand* anything to solve a challenge.
