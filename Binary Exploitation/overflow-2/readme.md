# OverFlow 2 - 250 Points

1. Create a rop tool for the program
   * This will create a ROP chain for you so you don't need to worry about putting all of the bytes in the right order.
2. Call the function at address 0x80485e6 (flag(), this address can be found with gdb/ghidra/ida)
   * Call the function with the two specified arguments
3. Compile the ropchain as a string
4. Send the ropchain to the program
   * 176 bytes padding to fill the buffer
   * 4 bytes padding for last return address
   * 4 bytes padding for the next return address
   * 4 bytes padding ???
   * ropchain payload
 
Note: Determining the amount you need to write to reach the return address can be hard.
Ghidra can decompile the program and tell you the exact offset in the stack that the buffer starts
so you know exactly how much you need to write to reach the return address and start ROP.
