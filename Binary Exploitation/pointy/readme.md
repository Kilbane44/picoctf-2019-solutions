Reading the source code, the `retrieveProfessor` and `retrieveStudent` functions both read from the same `ADDRESSES` array. Because of this, we can load a student when the program asks for a professor, and vice-versa.

Compare the structs for Professor and Student:

```
struct Professor {
    char name[NAME_SIZE];
    int lastScore;
};
```

```
struct Student {
    char name[NAME_SIZE];
    void (*scoreProfessor)(struct Professor*, int);
};
```

The first value in the struct is always pointer to the name. This means the retrieveProfessor function can successfully retrieve students by name, and vica-versa.

The second value in Professor is a 4 byte value that we can control when we give a student a score.

The second value in Student is a 4 byte function pointer which points to the function that should be called when a student is scored.

If we make a professor give a score to a student, where that score is an address to a function, then on the second loop iteration we tell the program to read a Professor as if it was
a student, then the program will execute any code at the address stored in that professors `lastScore` value. Making that value the address of the `win` function will print the flag.

See the comments in the script for more details on exactly what to do.
