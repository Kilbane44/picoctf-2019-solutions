# rop32 - 400 Points

This is a classic x86 ROP challenge. The program has a ton of functions statically linked, giving us plenty of gadgets to use for ROP.

Rather than manually writing our own ropchain, we can use [ROPgadget](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget) to make one for us. This will create a ropchain that gets us a shell.

It's important to note that ROPgadgets default chain includes `0x0a` bytes. These bytes are newline characters, and gets will stop reading our input when it finds one. To deal with this, we just need to tell ROPgadget that these are badbytes and cannot be used in the ropchain.

To generate a working ropchain, use `ROPgadget --binary ./vuln --ropchain --badbytes 0a`
