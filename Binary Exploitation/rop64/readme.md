# rop64 - 400 Points

This is a classic x86_64 ROP challenge. The program has a ton of functions statically linked, giving us plenty of gadgets to use for ROP.

Rather than manually writing our own ropchain, we can use [ROPgadget](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget) to make one for us. This will create a ropchain that gets us a shell.

ROPgadget doesn't give us any badbytes issues with this challenge unlike rop32, so the default chain works fine.

To generate a working ropchain, use `ROPgadget --binary ./vuln --ropchain`
