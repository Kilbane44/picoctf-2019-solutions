# seed-sPRiNG - 350 Points

This problem needs you to enter 30 unknown randomly generated numbers in the correct order to print the flag.

The program uses libc's pseudo-random number generator to create the numbers. Given a seed, it will produce random-enough numbers as long as you don't care about security.

Loading the program into Ghidra, you can see that is uses the common technique of using the system time (seconds since unix epoch) as the seed, which is passed into srand()
to set the seed for rand().

The idea is to create a program which uses the same srand() and rand() as the challenge and pass in the same seed to produce the same set of random numbers as the challenge. You can try syncing your system up to match the server, or, since the netcat challenge is run on the shell server, you can just connect to the shell server and run your program at the same time that you connect to the challenge with netcat.
