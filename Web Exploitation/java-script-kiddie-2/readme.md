# Java Script Kiddie 2 - 450 Points

This challenge is actually *easier* than Java Script Kiddie 1, provided you are good at spotting issues in the code. Here's what changed from Java Script Kiddie 1:

* The key is now 32 bytes long **BUT** only every other byte is actually used, so technically the key is still only 16 bytes long and every other byte is filler!
* The number of valid characters is significantly decreased due to the following line of the source code:
    ```
    shifter = Number(key.slice((i*2),(i*2)+1));
    ```
    The `Number` function will only return a valid character if the character passed in was a digit. This means the only possible characters are 0123456789.

Applying the change to the shifter function of our source code and reducing the valid character set, we find that *only 4 keys create a valid PNG header* and *only one of them create a valid PNG*.
