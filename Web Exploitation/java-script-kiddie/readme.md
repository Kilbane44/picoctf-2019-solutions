This challenge involves inputting the "correct" key to convert the site's byte array into a valid image to get the flag. There are actually many valid keys.

The source code of the website revelas that it tries to render a PNG. A PNG has to have certain bytes intact to be considered a valid PNG. Every single PNG will have the following as the first 8 bytes in the file:

`89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A  (.PNG....)`

and *most* PNGs will have the following 8 bytes to start a valid IHDR chunk (the IHDR chunk is always the first chunk in a PNG file so if it is present it will always be here):

`00 00 00 0D 49 48 44 52 (IHDR....)`

With this, we have 16 known bytes of the correct image, and conveniently the key is 16 bytes long, so we can use these bytes to brute force valid keys.

Our solution generates a list of every single possible key based on valid characters which are ASCII and typically typed into an HTML textbox. The key is then used on the website's byte array to produce the output image for that key. The image is then written to a file.

There are over a thousand possible keys, but thankfully our friend Windows File Explorer tries to preview every single one, so it's easy to scroll through the folder of images and see which ones worked.

Scan one of the QR codes to get the flag.
